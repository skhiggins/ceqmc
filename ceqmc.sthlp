{title:Description}

{pstd} 
The command {cmd:ceqmc} estimates marginal contributions for Gini, poverty gap and square poverty gap.
To be able to identify the marginal contribution of a fiscal intervention, {cmd: ceqmc} needs {opth inc(varname)} (income of reference) and the intervention whether it is a tax ({opth tax(varname)} or a transfer {opth ben(varname)}). Only one intervention can be measured at a time. 
 The poverty line can be a number or a variable but has to be in the same unit as the income and the intervention variables.
